API Secrets
RAPT Portal | API Secrets

PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE RAPT API

The URL for the Api is: https://api.rapt.io

Opening that address in your browser will load a Swagger interface which details the available endpoints on the Api, including parameters and response models where applicable.

The Api requires a bearer token to be included within an Authorization header for all requests. 

API SECRETS

Before you can obtain a bearer token, you will require an Api Secret.  Create an Api secret by clicking the "Add Api Secret" button on the Api Secrets page within the Rapt Cloud Dashboard. Please note that once a secret has been created, it is hashed and unrecoverable. You will need to record the secret when it is shown to you, as you will not be able to see it again from the Rapt Cloud. 

BEARER TOKENS

To obtain a bearer token, you will need to make a request to the Rapt authentication server (https://id.rapt.io). This request will need both your username and an api key. The response will contain a bearer token that will be valid for 60 minutes.

curl --location --request POST 'https://id.rapt.io/connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=rapt-user' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
--data-urlencode 'username={enter your username}' \
--data-urlencode 'password={enter your api key}'


SUPPORT & API [MIS]USE

Access to the Api is unsupported. This means you will not get assistance from KegLand with regards to any issues you may encounter while using the Api.

If your use of the Api causes problems with your Rapt account or devices, this is on you. We track all Api requests, so if you destroy a device through misuse of the Api, it will void your warranty.

If your use of the Api causes problems with other Rapt users, depending on the severity of the problem, you will be given a warning and/or your access to the Api will be revoked.

Extreme abuse of the Api will result in a permanent ban from the Rapt ecosystem, meaning the devices you have purchased will be all but useless.

The Api (endpoints, parameters, response models etc.) is subject to change without notice.
